    <em>A <strong>NOOB</strong> with a <strong>dream</strong></em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Kia Ora, my name is Jared, I am 26 and I am from Whangarei. I recently completed a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Arts (Digital). I have also completed almost two years of a Bachelor of Primary School Teaching, however, I found it was not the
    career path I wanted to take (at the time I felt I was too young, I was 20) so I started from scratch to achieve my Digital Arts qualification.

    I work hard and I try to deliver as much as I can in the time provided. I love to learn new things and I learn quite quickly. I work well with others, however, I can work fine by myself too.

    I am not just interested in getting a job in the arts exclusively.
